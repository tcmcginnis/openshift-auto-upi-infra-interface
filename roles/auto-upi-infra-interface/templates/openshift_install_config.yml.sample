  # Version of OpenShift to be installed (OCP or OKD).

  # Unique name of the OpenShift cluster which also becomes a part of cluster's FQDN.
  name: mycluster
  # Base domain which is appended to the cluster's name to form a cluster FQDN.

  # Number of master nodes. Set this to 3 to achieve a highly-available control plane.

  # Number of worker nodes equals to the number of infra nodes + the number of app nodes.
  # Typical production installation will have 3 infra nodes. Regardless of how many
  # worker nodes you will deploy, you must set the value of the replicas parameter to 0.
  # This parameter controls the number of workers that the cluster creates and manages
  # for you, which are functions that the cluster does not perform when you use
  # user-provisioned infrastructure.

  # Configure OpenShift hosts using static IPs as opposed to using DHCP.
  # This feature is currently supported for bare metal, libvirt_pxe, oVirt, and vSphere.
  # It is not supported for libvirt_fwcfg.
  # For bare metal and libvirt_pxe, the PXE menu config is modified to include the
  # static IP configuration.
  # For oVirt and vSphere, a boot ISO is created that includes a custom GRUB boot loader
  # configuration that includes the static IP configuration. This custom GRUB confguration
  # is used only during the first boot of the OpenShift hosts. Following boots will go
  # back to using the factory GRUB configuration.

    # Must enable in order to use the static IP provisioning.
